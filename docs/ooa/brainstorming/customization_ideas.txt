- accent color for icons, automatic re-rendering of icons
- icons are cached so they do not need to be redrawn every time they are loaded
- accent color can be a gradient (linear, radial, ...) or a solid color
- color schemes for application (light, dark, more elaborate, ...)
- FOR WINDOWS 10+ (and all OSses that expose APIs to monitor and query):
 - use system-defined accent color, update without app restart
 - use system-defined theme (dark, light)
- animated windows?
- predefined application styles?
- icon overrides by plug-ins?
